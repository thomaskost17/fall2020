## Tasks Planned

- Github Setup
    - Simple CI/CD automations (doesnt have to do much for now)
    - Kanban Board and workflow specification
    - Clang format and clang-tidy for any C/C++/CUDA to be written
    - Start format for Wiki
    - Rough File Structure
- Week 1 Tutorial

###  Tasks Completed

- Github has not yet been able to be setup as we have not been added as members on the repository yet. However, as noted last week I have written many of the files, have a rough structure, and selected the simple inbuilt actions that we will want to start with for our setup. I will begin the process of adding the files to the github when access is given
- Raspberry pi zero W has not yet arrived, but I was able to make do with a Raspberry Pi zero I have laying around. I used this to run through the hardware tutorial and set up the raspberry pi as suggested with a new microSD card. As I have done much of this process before
- I have also been reading up on the applications of OpenCV to AR. I have also continued looking through the documentation to more fully flush out the capabilities. 
- I also did a little reading on how MQTT works to try to get a better understanding of what is going on when the MQTT code is ran.

### Future Direction

- As we just got access to the git I will be setting that up. 
- Complete week 3 tutorial. 
- Complete project proposal with team
